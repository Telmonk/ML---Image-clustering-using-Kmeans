# ML---Image-clustering-using-Kmeans
Here the goal is to find a mapping of the archive images into classes (clusters) such that the set of classes provide essentially the same information about  the image archive as the entire image-set collection. The  data set contains large no. of images which are to be clustered  into 10 parts. For this project, the dataset of 118 classes of fruits   and vegetables has been taken from kaggle.com   containing 80653 images.
